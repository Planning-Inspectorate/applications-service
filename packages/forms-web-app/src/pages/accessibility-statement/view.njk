          It has been observed that if a user is navigating the page with Dragon Naturally Speaking enabled, they are unable to expand the additional information on the Project Information details components.
          This does not comply with WCAG Level A 2.1: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value.
          <br>
          This issue requires a fix in Dragon Naturally Speaking.
          As an alternative, users can use MouseGrid, a feature in the Windows Speech Recognition app.

        <li>
          If a user is navigating the page with iOS VoiceOver enabled, the user is not notified that there is additional information which has not been expanded on the screen.
          Because of this, the user would not know that there is more information within the Project Information components to be heard.
          If the user does click on the section to expand it, there is also no announcement to say this has happened.
