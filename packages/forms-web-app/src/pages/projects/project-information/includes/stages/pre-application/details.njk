	This is where the developer starts to create their application. This is where the developer must run a consultation
	and engage with people and organisations in the area. They must also create detailed documents about the impact the
	project could have on the environment.
	<br>
	<br>
	This stage is your opportunity to get involved and influence the application before the developer sends it to the
	Planning Inspectorate.
