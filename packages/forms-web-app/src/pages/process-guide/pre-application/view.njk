				<p class="govuk-body">
          Before an applicant sends their application for a proposed development to the Planning Inspectorate, they must carry out public consultation.
					This feedback will then be taken into account and used to help shape the proposed project.
					This happens at the pre-application stage.
        </p>

				<p class="govuk-body">
          The applicant must consult:
        </p>

				<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
					<li>the general public</li>
					<li>parish councils</li>
					<li>statutory consultees</li>
					<li>local authorities and councils</li>
					<li>land owners and tenants</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="govuk-body">
          They must consider all comments and information from members of the public and organisations.
        </p>

				<p class="govuk-body">
          Getting involved in the applicant's consultation during the pre-application stage is very important.
					This is your opportunity to put forward any questions and concerns, learn more about the development and how it might effect the area.
