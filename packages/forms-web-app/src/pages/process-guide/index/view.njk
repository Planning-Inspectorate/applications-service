        Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are submitted to the Planning Inspectorate who examines the proposal.

        Anyone can get involved:

			<p class="govuk-body">
        An applicant submits an application for a development consent order to the Planning Inspectorate. These can be developments like:

			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>offshore wind farms</li>
				<li>power stations and electric lines</li>
				<li>motorways and other major roads</li>
				<li>railways</li>
				<li>gas pipelines</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="govuk-body">
        The Planning Inspectorate is a government agency.
				Independent inspectors make a recommendation to the relevant Secretary of State about if permission for a proposed development should be granted.
				The relevant Secretary of State makes the final decision.
			</p>

			<p class="govuk-body">
        There are several stages in the process for considering whether a national infrastructure project should receive consent.
				The whole process can take around 18 months.
