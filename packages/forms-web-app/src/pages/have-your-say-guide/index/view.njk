				This guide is for individuals and organisations who want to have their say about a project.

			<p class="govuk-body">
				National infrastructure projects are also called Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP).
				These are large scale developments like:
			</p>

			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>offshore wind farms</li>
				<li>power stations and electric lines</li>
				<li>motorways and other major roads</li>
				<li>railways</li>
				<li>gas pipelines</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="govuk-body">
				The process for national infrastructure projects is to decide if a Development Consent Order (DCO) can be granted.
				A DCO is a legal document that allows an applicant to build their proposed project.
				The applicant submits an application for a proposed development to the Planning Inspectorate.
				A panel of independent inspectors called the Examining Authority look at the project and start the examination of the application.
				They make a recommendation to the relevant Secretary of State about whether the project should go ahead.
			</p>

			<p class="govuk-body">
				As part of this process, anyone can have their say about the project and tell us why they think it should or should not go ahead.
