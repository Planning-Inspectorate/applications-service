					What happens at the pre-application stage
				</h2>

				<p class="govuk-body">
					Before the applicant sends their application for a proposed national infrastructure development to the Planning Inspectorate, they must carry out public consultation.
					This happens at the pre-application stage.
				</p>

				<p class="govuk-body">
					The applicant must consult:
				</p>

				<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
					<li>the general public</li>
					<li>parish councils</li>
					<li>statutory consultees</li>
					<li>local authorities and councils</li>
					<li>land owners and tenants</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="govuk-body">
					They must gather all comments and information from members of the public and organisations.
					This feedback is taken into account and used to help shape the proposed project.
				</p>

				<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-the-applicant-must-do">
					What the applicant must do
				</h2>

				<p class="govuk-body">
					The applicant must advertise their consultation period.
				</p>

				<p class="govuk-body">
					The advert must appear for at least two weeks and include:
				</p>

				<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
					<li>a description of the project</li>
					<li>where you can find out more about the project</li>
					<li>the deadline for sending them your comments</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="govuk-body">
					The applicant must also contact consultees and anyone whose land is affected by the proposed development.
				</p>

				<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-you-can-get-involved-at-this-point">
					How you can get involved at this point
				</h2>

				<p class="govuk-body">
					You need to contact the applicant to get involved at this stage.
				</p>

				<p class="govuk-body">
					If there is a project page on this website, you can find the applicant's details here.
					Alternatively, you can find information in local news or ask your local authority.
				</p>

				<p class="govuk-body">
					Getting involved in the applicant's consultation during the pre-application stage is very important.
					This is your opportunity to put forward any questions and concerns, and find out more about the development and how it might impact the area.
				</p>

				<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-you-can-do-if-the-application-has-already-been-submitted">
					What you can do if the application has already been submitted
				</h2>

				<p class="govuk-body">
					If the application has been sent to the Planning Inspectorate, you can get involved by registering to have your say.
				</p>

				<p class="govuk-body">
					You must do this when the project is in the pre-examination stage.
