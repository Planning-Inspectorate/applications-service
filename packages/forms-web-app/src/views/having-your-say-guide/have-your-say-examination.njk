				<h2 id="what-examination-means" class="govuk-heading-m">What Examination means</h2>
				<p class="govuk-body">The Examination stage is where the Examining Authority will look at the proposed project
					and ask questions.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">The developer, anyone who is registered to have their say, and anyone else involved in the
					project can comment on the proposed development or answer any of the questions at each deadline.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">This is usually done in writing. The Examining Authority will create and publish a
					document of their questions. The Examination may also involve hearings if there are issues that need to be
					discussed in more detail.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">The Examining Authority will send you a timetable with the dates of each deadline for
					sending your comments. All comments will be published in the project section of this website after theyâ€™ve
					been received.</p>

				<h2 id="how-to-comment-during-examination" class="govuk-heading-m">How to comment during examination</h2>
				<p class="govuk-body">All project documents, comments from others who have registered or have a statutory right,
					and Examination questions will be published in the specific project section of this website.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">You can view these documents and make comments by filling in the online form in the
					project section of this website.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">If you have difficulty using online services, you can also send us information by email or
					post. You can check the project information in the project section of this website to find contact details for
					the Planning Inspectorate's case team.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">Your name and comments will be published alongside the other documents in the project
					section of this website. Your address, email address and telephone number will be kept private. <a

				<h2 id="missed-deadline" class="govuk-heading-m">If you have missed the deadline to register to have your
					say</h2>
				<p class="govuk-body">You can still look at all of the project information and use the submission form at the
					Examination stage to submit information, but there is no guarantee that your views will be included in the
					Examination of the application.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">If you choose to submit information at Examination without being registered, the Examining
					Authority will decide if your views can be taken into account.</p>

				<h2 id="more-detailed-advice" class="govuk-heading-m">More detailed advice</h2>
				<p class="govuk-body">If you need more detailed advice, you can check our advice notes for more information.</p>
