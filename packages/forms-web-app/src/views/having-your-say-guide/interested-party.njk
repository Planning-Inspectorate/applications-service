      Having your say about a national infrastructure project
    </h1>
    <p class="govuk-body">This guide is for individuals and organisations who want to have their say about a project.</p>
    <p>National infrastructure projects are also called Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP). They are large developments which cross the threshold from a normal planning application because of the impact they may have. This can be developments like:</p>
   <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>offshore wind farms</li>
        <li>power stations and electric lines</li>
        <li>motorways and other major roads</li>
        <li>railways</li>
        <li>gas pipelines</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The process for national infrastructure projects is to decide if a Development Consent Order (DCO) can be granted. A DCO is a legal document that allows a developer to build their proposed project. The developer submits an application for a proposed development to the Planning Inspectorate. A panel of independent inspectors examine the project and make a recommendation to the Secretary of State about if the project should go ahead.</p>
      <p>As part of this process, anyone can have their say about the project and tell us why they think it should or should not go ahead.</p>
    {# <p class="govuk-body">For more information about the overall process and everyone involved, there is a guide about <a class="govuk-link" href="../dco-process-guide/index.html">the process for national infrastructure projects</a>.</p> #}
