				Having your say about a national infrastructure project
			</h1>
			<p class="govuk-body">This guide is for individuals and organisations who want to have their say about a
				project.</p>
			<p class="govuk-body">National infrastructure projects are also called Nationally Significant Infrastructure
				Projects (NSIP). They are large developments which cross the threshold from a normal planning application
				because of the impact they may have. This can be developments like:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>offshore wind farms</li>
				<li>power stations and electric lines</li>
				<li>motorways and other major roads</li>
				<li>railways</li>
				<li>gas pipelines</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="govuk-body">The process for national infrastructure projects is to decide if a Development Consent Order
				(DCO) can be granted. A DCO is a legal document that allows a developer to build their proposed project. The
				developer submits an application for a proposed development to the Planning Inspectorate. A panel of independent
				inspectors examine the project and make a recommendation to the Secretary of State about if the project should
				go ahead.</p>
			<p class="govuk-body">As part of this process, anyone can have their say about the project and tell us why they
				think it should or should not go ahead.</p>
