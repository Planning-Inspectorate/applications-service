      Having your say about a national infrastructure project
    </h1>
    <p class="govuk-body">This guide is for individuals and organisations who want to have their say about a project.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">National infrastructure projects are also called Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP). They are large developments which cross the threshold from a normal planning application because of the impact they will have. This can be developments like:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>offshore wind farms</li>
      <li>power stations</li>
      <li>main roads</li>
      <li>railways</li>
      <li>utilities (new cables and water pipes)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">The overall process is called the Development Consent Order (DCO) process. A developer submits their application to the Planning Inspectorate and we examine the project and make a recommendation to the Secretary of State about if the project should go ahead.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">As part of this process, members of the public, organisations and people acting on behalf of others can have their say about the project and tell us why they think it should or should not go ahead.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">For more information about the overall process and everyone involved, there is a guide about <a class="govuk-link" href="../dco-process-guide/index.html">the process for national infrastructure projects</a>.</p>
