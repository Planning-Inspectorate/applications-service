                <p class="govuk-body">To get involved at this stage, you must be registered as an interested party, and have an interested party reference.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Examination is when the inspector or panel of inspectors, known as the examining authority, will look at any evidence or comments from interested parties and all other parties involved. This is usually done in writing, but you may also be asked questions by the panel at any hearings that might happen as part of the process.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">The examining authority will send you a timetable with the dates of each deadline for sending your comments. All comments will be published on the project section of the website after they’ve been received.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">You must register to have your say and tell us why this project affects you during the registration period. By registering, you become an interested party and get an interested party reference.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Once you have registered, you can check what all other parties have submitted. You can then comment on that information before each deadline. Their documents will be published in the specific project section of this website.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">You can send your comments by:</p>
