      <p class="govuk-body">After the registration period has closed, you will be sent a letter called the Rule 6 letter, telling you when and where the Preliminary Meeting will be held. This is to talk about how the application will be examined. It will also include a draft timetable for the Examination of the application.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How and when to submit more information</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can submit more information by completing the form on the project page. You will need your interested party reference number to make sure your comments are included in the Examination of the application.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will let you know when the Examination of this application starts.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can check our guide to <a href="/interested-party-guide" target="_blank">find out more about having your say during the Examination of the application, (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
