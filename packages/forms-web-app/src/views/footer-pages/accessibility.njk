        <p class="govuk-body">
          The Planning Inspectorate is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
                </p> <br>
        <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below.
        </p> <br>
        <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
        </p> <br>
        <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The site uses iframes to embed google maps and Youtube videos on some pages. The tab order is not always logical on these and there are also some contrast issues.
  The majority of documents we publish on this site are produced by third parties. We are not able to make these fully compliant, for example adding alternative text to images or diagrams. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).
        </p> <br>
        <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Some of our older documents don’t meet accessibility standards. For example, they: <br> <br>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>  do not contain alternative text for diagrams and/or images – this does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 </li>
        <li>  use images of text, rather than plain text – this does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.5</li>
        <li>  are not structured properly – this does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2</li> <br><br>
          The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services.
          Any new documents that we author and publish should meet the accessibility standards. <br><br>

          All video content currently published to the website will include closed captioning subtitles.

        <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">
The audit of the site in May 2020 identified 30 issues with the structure of the site and the HTML content.  Updates to the site have resolved these aside from the exceptions listed in the non-compliance section above.  The latest release in February 2021 replaced the calendar based view of examination stage events across all projects with an accessible version.
