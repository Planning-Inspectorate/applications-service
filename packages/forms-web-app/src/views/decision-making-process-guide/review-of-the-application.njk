				<p class="govuk-body">This is where the developer sends us their application. The application must include all

					examination. We have 28 days to make this decision.</p>

				<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
					<li>we accept the application for examination</li>
					<li>we do not accept the application</li>
					<li>the developer withdraws their application</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="govuk-body">If it is accepted, the application will progress to the pre-examination stage.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">The examining authority examines the application and makes a recommendation to the
					relevant Secretary of State, who then decides whether the development can go ahead.</p>
