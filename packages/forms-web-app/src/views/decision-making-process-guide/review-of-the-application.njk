        <p class="govuk-body">This is called the Acceptance stage. This when the developer sends us all of the information in their application, including details of the consultation they have carried out. The Planning Inspectorate looks at the documents to check if we can accept the application for Examination. We have 28 days to make this decision.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This stage can have one of three outcomes:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>we accept the application for examination</li>
          <li>we do not accept the application</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">We have 28 days to make the decision from when the developer sends us the application. If it is accepted, this does not mean the development can go ahead, this means we’ve accepted the application for Examination.</p>
