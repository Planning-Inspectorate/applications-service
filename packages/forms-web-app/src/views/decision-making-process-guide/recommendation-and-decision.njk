        <p class="govuk-body">After the examining authority has completed all its enquiries and understood everyone's views during the examination, it will then write its recommendation report. The report must be completed and sent to the Secretary of State within 3 months of the end of the examination.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The Secretary of State then has another 3 months to make the final decision. The Secretary of State considers the examining authorityâ€™s report to decide if the development should go ahead. When a decision is made, we will publish the decision and report on the relevant project overview page.</p>
