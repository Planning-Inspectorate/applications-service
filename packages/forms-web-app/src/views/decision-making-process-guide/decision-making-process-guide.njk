      The decision-making process for national infrastructure projects
    </h1>
			<p class="govuk-body">National infrastructure projects are also called Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP). Anyone can get involved in the decision-making process, including:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>developers</li>
				<li>members of the public</li>
				<li>statutory bodies</li>
				<li>charities</li>
				<li>local authorities</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="govuk-body">A developer submits an application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) to the Planning Inspectorate. These can be developments like:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>offshore wind farms</li>
				<li>power stations and electric lines</li>
				<li>motorways and other major roads</li>
				<li>railways</li>
				<li>gas pipelines</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="govuk-body">The Planning Inspectorate is a government agency. Independent inspectors make a recommendation to the Secretary of State about if permission for a development should be granted. The relevant Secretary of State makes the final decision.</p>
			<p class="govuk-body">There are several stages in the process for DCOs. The whole process can take around 18 months.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Guide for people or organisations who want to have their say</h2>

			<p class="govuk-body">You can get involved at the Pre-application stage before the developer submits their application to the Planning Inspectorate by contacting them.</p>
			<p class="govuk-body">If you want to register to have your say about a national infrastructure project, you can register during the Pre-examination stage.</p>
			<p class="govuk-body">There is a guide with information for <a class="govuk-link" href="../having-your-say-guide/">people or organisations who want to have their say about a national infrastructure project</a>.</p>
