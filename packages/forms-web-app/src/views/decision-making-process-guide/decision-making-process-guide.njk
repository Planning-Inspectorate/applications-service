			<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">The process for nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs)</h1>
			<p class="govuk-body">Nationally significant infrastructure projects are submitted to the planning inspectorate who examines the proposal.</p>
			<p class="govuk-body">Anyone can get involved:
			</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>developers</li>
				<li>members of the public</li>
				<li>statutory bodies</li>
				<li>charities</li>
				<li>local authorities</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="govuk-body">A developer submits an application for a development consent order to the planning inspectorate. These can be developments like:
			</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>offshore wind farms</li>
				<li>power stations and electric lines</li>
				<li>motorways and other major roads</li>
				<li>railways</li>
				<li>gas pipelines</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The planning inspectorate is a government agency. Independent inspectors make a recommendation to the relevant Secretary of State about if permission for a proposed development should be granted. The relevant Secretary of State makes the final decision.
			</p>
			<p class="govuk-body">There are several stages in the process for considering whether a national infrastructure project should receive consent. The whole process can take around 18 months.
			</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Guide for people or organisations who want to have their say</h2>

			<p class="govuk-body">You can get involved at the pre-application stage by contacting the developer before they submit their application to the planning inspectorate.
			</p>
			<p class="govuk-body">If you want to register to have your say about a national infrastructure project, you can register during the pre-examination stage.
			</p>
			<p>There is a
