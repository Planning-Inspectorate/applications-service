        <p class="govuk-body">The pre-examination stage is where we prepare for an examination. The examining authority is made up of one or more inspectors who will plan for the examination stage.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This involves the examining authority deciding which issues will need to be discussed and what questions it might need to ask.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The examining authority will:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>plan what happens during the examination
          </li>
          <li>arrange any hearings
          </li>
          <li>set draft deadlines for comment
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="registering-to-have-your-say">Registering to have your say</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">You must register during the pre-examination stage to have your say.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The registration for each project will be open for at least 28 days to give you time to register. The deadline for registering will be in the developer's advert, or you can check the project page.</p>
        <p>There is a separate guide with more information about the steps in the process for
          <a class="govuk-link" href="../having-your-say-guide/">people or organisations who want to have their say about a national infrastructure project</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="the-preliminary-meeting">Preliminary meeting</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">The examining authority will hold a preliminary meeting in the months after the register to have your say period closes.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Several weeks before this meeting, the rule 6 letter is sent to everyone registered to have their say, official bodies and people whose land is directly affected. The rule 6 letter tells everyone when and where the meeting will be held. It will also include a draft timetable for the examination of the application.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You cannot give your views about the proposed development at this meeting.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You can talk about:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>anything that may affect your ability to attend hearings or meet deadlines, for example other local events happening at the same time or issues with travel or working patterns</li>
          <li>if there are any suitable local places to hold the hearings</li>
          <li>if there are any groups of people who need a different approach to be able to take part in the process</li>
          <li>any other matters relating to the draft Examination timetable</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-happens-next">What happens next</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">We will publish the meeting note and a live stream recording on the project section of this website around a week after the preliminary meeting.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The rule 8 letter is sent to everyone who registered, as well as official bodies and people whose land is directly affected. This will have details of the examination including the finalised timetable with all deadlines for examination comments.</p>
