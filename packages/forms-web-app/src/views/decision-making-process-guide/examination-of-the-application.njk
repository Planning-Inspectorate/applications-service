        <p class="govuk-body">The examination stage is where the examining authority will look at the proposed project and ask questions.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The developer, anyone who is registered to have their say, official bodies and people whose land is directly affected can comment on the proposed development or answer any of the questions at each deadline.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This is usually done in writing. The examining authority will publish their questions at the times indicated in the examination timetable. The examination may also involve hearings if there are issues that the examining inspectors consider require discussing in detail.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This stage takes up to 6 months.</p>
