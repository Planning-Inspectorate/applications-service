				<p class="govuk-body">Before a developer sends their application for a proposed development to the planning
					inspectorate, they must carry out public consultation. This feedback will then be taken into account and used
					to help shape the proposed project. This happens at the pre-application stage.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">The developer must consult:</p>
				<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
					<li>the general public</li>
					<li>parish councils</li>
					<li>statutory consultees</li>
					<li>local authorities and councils</li>
					<li>land owners and tenants</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="govuk-body">They must consider all comments and information from members of the public and
					organisations.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">Getting involved in the developer's consultation during the pre-application stage is very
					important. This is your opportunity to put forward any questions and concerns, learn more about the
					development and how it might affect the area.</p>
